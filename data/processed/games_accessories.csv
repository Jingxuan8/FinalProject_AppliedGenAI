An unusual spin on a typical roll-the-dice-and-move game, it spotlights the mathematical concept of place value and gives kids reinforcement in what makes our base-10 number system tick. Each player is allotted one dinosaur for each of the four tracks (the tracks are labeled 1s, 10s, 100s, and 1000s). To play, a player rolls four dice to create a 4-digit number and then moves his or her prehistoric posse to the appropriate 1s, 10s, 100s, and 1000s places. Problem-solving strategies are honed as players scurry to get all four miniature mammoths or tiny triceratops into the dino haven, ahead of the other players' thundering herds. But look out! In the race to dino utopia, it's easy to get bumped by a baby brachiosaurus! The Dino Math Tracks game provides multiple levels of play for a variety of ages. At the simplest level (perfect for a first-grader who knows Arabic numerals and one-to-one correspondence), kids use only the place track for the 1s. Later, cards with simple problems are introduced (""Stuck in a tar pit! Move your 10s dino back two spaces!""). At the most advanced level, players might encounter a question like this: ""Your 10s dinosaur forgot its pants, so it went back 15 to get them. Then it hurried forward 25. How far did it get? Move that many."" Young players will find the 2-inch, spunky vinyl dinosaur playing pieces irresistible. The game offers plenty of opportunities for friendly competition and brain bending--not to mention lots of nonthreatening practice at addition and subtraction. --Julie Ubben See all Product description | 1 pounds (View shipping rates and policies)",,0.45359237,38.55884965613508,https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Resources-Dino-Math-Tracks/dp/B00004TDKU

The first candidates step forward, a motley bunch indeed. Which one has the skills to become a worthy member of the gang? To determine this, the boss himself stages a smuggling contest. First the would-be smugglers must try to get through a hole in a fence while carrying the biggest sack of contraband possible. Then those who make it through the hole have a chance to inspect the other smugglers' sacks that are smaller than their own or that shamefully got stuck in the hole in the fence. A role of the die determines which size hole in the fence the sack needs to fit through. The smuggling sacks are formed from a rubbery polymer putty that the players roll into balls with the contraband pieces hidden inside. The balls are then rolled down a track toward the fence. The player's goal is to form the largest ball that will still fit through the fence. Players who succeed in getting the largest ball through the hole in the fence can then guess the contents of the smaller balls or of balls that were too large to fit through the fence. If they guess correctly, they get to keep the contraband. The player who collects the most contraband items wins.

Designed for and by Boston natives, it's got all the landmarks that make Bean Town such a special city--Beacon Hill, Fenway Park, the USS Constitution, and more. Like Monopoly, this game for two to six players starts with everyone receiving a stash of cash. With a roll of the dice, the players round the board, landing on various properties like the Old North Church, Copley Place, or the Union Oyster House. When you land on a property, you can opt to purchase it, trade it, or pay rent. Two kinds of wild cards, Big Fun and Contingency, spice up the competitive action. Anyone who owns large blocks of property can build a skyline, or, when it's fully developed, trade the buildings in for the key to the city. For those poor souls who exhibit poor financial judgment, there's always the option of a mortgage--if the IRS doesn't get them first--to keep their dreams afloat. --Marianne Painter See all Product description | 1.95 pounds (View shipping rates and policies)",,0.8845051215,22.55498528506824,https://www.amazon.com/Late-for-the-Sky-Boston-opoly/dp/B00000JMNU

On a spaceship 50 miles long with more than a million colonists, Epsilon City was the single largest habitation. It was filled with entertainment centers, apartments, and offices for all the people moving about the ship during the long voyage. The city was designed to be maintained by its own artificial intelligence (A.I.) and a special series of robots that could repair areas of the city when breakdowns happened. Epsilon City was less than half full when an interstellar radiation cloud destroyed the people of the ship and turned 99% of them into piles of white ash. The city was wiped out. Now, three hundred years later, things are vastly different in the city. The A.I. is insane and has an aggressive personality. The special robots have had to change or be destroyed, and have mutated much like the rest of the life on the ship. Wolfoid packs now inhabit many sections of the city and consider this metropolis their lair. And many more dangers lurk, hidden and waiting to be explored. The original edition of Metamorphosis Alpha has celebrated its 40th anniversary! In honor of this milestone, creator James M. Ward has authorized Goodman Games to publish Metamorphosis Alpha: Epsilon City. This huge expansion for the starship Warden is the biggest expansion for the original 1976 edition ever published!

The action die determines what obstacle Olaf must face, such as warming up the token in a player's hands, or even breathing on it! The last player with their Olaf token standing wins the game. The Olaf's Ice Adventure edition of the Trouble game makes a fantastic gift for fans of Disney's Frozen.

Amazon.com Younger kids can develop their powers of logic and deduction in this game of code-cracking fun. This version is simplified for younger children and comes with colorful animal pegs, a jungle-and-mountain-theme board, and fewer code options. The point is the same: one player duplicates the other's code in as few turns as possible. The code maker sets a code of 3 colored animals (choosing from 72 in six colors), and conceals it beneath a ""rocky mountain"" tray at his or her side of the board. In each of nine rows (of large holes), the code breaker attempts to replicate the pattern. After each row (or turn), the code maker places red or white creature pieces in the adjacent row of small holes, which gives the code breaker clues on how he or she doing. Complete instructions include rules for younger players (based on colors only), older players (color and position), and expert players (a blank-space option adds complexity).

Very few people can withstand the hardships of the lonesome life a shepherd of giant silkworms leads. It is a solitary existence that requires great dedication and strength of character to bear the pressures that stem from competing with the few other shepherds who fight over the scarce but desirable feeding grounds, while keeping the fearsome ookamy at bay. Silk is a gateway game into area control and worker placement systems. Players have to move their silkworms to the optimal spaces so they can feed on the best grass available, while pushing the other players' pieces into less desirable feeding grounds. In this game, players roll dice in order to determine which actions they are allowed to perform during their turn. There are six types of actions available: breeding more silkworms, moving the shepherd or their mastiff, building fences or farms, moving the ookami monster around the board, and — most importantly — getting your silkworms to feed. When silkworms feed, they generate a number of silk points, depending on the type of terrain they are standing on at that moment. These points can be used to modify the outcome of a dice roll, all while keeping in mind that the player with the most silk points at the end of the game wins! | 1.5 pounds (View shipping rates and policies)",,0.6803885550000001,42.696191443137955,https://www.amazon.com/Devir-Games-Silk/dp/B07JL9PNG1

Steampunk is something more than cogs, wheels or the dames and gentlemen in fancy clothes. It’s a whole another dimension of fandom, things, people, the entire aesthetics. Steampunk is like the dreams of Jules Verne come true and in style of the most sophisticated Victorian paragons. We in Q WORKSHOP value style, so we must design steampunk sets of dice in many wonderful colors. We have in mind the dice that shout: Full steam ahead! Bring me that horizon! These are sets for heroes in brass and copper wonders of retro-futuristic technology, that never was, but it should have been. To comply with these requirements, our dice are from best material and deeply engraved with festoons of cogs and clock mechanisms. We put our hearts in this project because the spirit of probably long dead romanticism is one of the ghosts that we will resurrect in his former glory, full of passion and joie de vivre. This spirit will be not trapped inside dice, but combined with secret ingredients, that we mix up in our casting vats. I can reveal to you, that we use the ground parts of one mad scientist’s machinery, that we bought at an auction in London. Thousand and one dice from parts of the machine! OK, I reveal to you another secret: These dice are made from parts of a mad scientist machinery that was supposed to influence the fate of those who use it. Unfortunately for the scientist, the matter of the machine warped in the process, leaving behind only many parts and cogs that act like lucky charms. That's what we have ground and inserted in our vats. The power of this machine is still imbued within the dice, ensuring the paint doesn't wear off and altering the fate of their users. Yellow & Black – in the Victorian world sun never sets in the United Empire of our dear queen. These are dice to commemorate this colonial dream come true. And one piece of advice from a seasoned steampunk journeyman: Remember, that yellow sun always is the best guide. Wherever your hero is in the foreign land, he or she should look for the sun and they will be no longer lost. From the Manufacturer These cubes are a part of a mad scientist machinery, that was supposed to influence time fate of those, who use it. Unfortunately for the scientist, the matter of the machine warped in the process, leaving behind only those cubes with the machine carved in them. The machine still works in the dice, ensuring the paint doesn't wear off and altering the fate of those who use it. | 1.44 ounces (View shipping rates and policies)",,0.040823279999999997,367.43740336396297,https://www.amazon.com/Q-Workshop-Polyhedral-7-Die-Set-Steampunk/dp/B003KE4MLQ

Classic is never outdated, never embarrassing and is a proof of a sense of style. It fits everything and is useful in every situation. It fits everyone, not only the rich and the snobs. The classic can be simple or sophisticated but it is never vulgarly ornate. The golden rule of moderation is what distinguishes it from all other things. So, how does the Q Workshop understand the classic Runic RPG dice? It is a set of polyhedral dice made from best materials according to a classically elegant design and crafted with simple but beautiful Runic font, readable as never before. These are no trinkets. It is a very useful set for all games. Available in many colors, these dice should help your heroes explore Dungeons, fight with Dragons, and let them find the right adventurous path in all worlds. These sets will be your friends. Take them with you wherever you play your favorite games. We are proud of our classic Runic dice sets because the simplicity of these game-tools has been combined with aesthetics. No one has the right to say that classic means boring and ordinary. We create beautiful dice, classic is not a deviation from this principle. The meaning of colors> colors play a very important role in our lives, whether we realize it or not. They have the ability to affect our emotions and moods in a way that few other things can. When you create your character, you should ask yourself what color suits your hero? What will be the best way to show his or her personality and tell something about it to other players? Maybe it is also worth choosing a special color for them. This non-verbal signal Can be a great help to create a more immersive atmosphere during the game. Should a warrior mage roll red and peaceful mystic green or maybe purple because he is noble? Show your colors with our classic Runic dice sets. For example: classic Runic Glacier & black dice set - This is second Runic ice set cut out from the heart of the Glacier that covers an ancient battlefield near our factory. This iceberg is hid deep underground and enclosed with dark magic From times of legends. This ice is so petrified that it will never melt and always will be helping you in your adventures. If you don't believe in this story, it is not a problem, because real glaciers can wait for aeons for the right person, and these dice are waiting for a faithful user. | 1.6 ounces (View shipping rates and policies)",,0.0453592,154.32370941286442,https://www.amazon.com/WORKSHOP-Classic-Runic-Glacier-Black/dp/B07ZGGQJYB

Runic dice are one of the first ever created by designers in Q WORKSHOP, and we always remember them, as our first step to conquering the world with our dice. First Runic Dice were handmade and hand-painted in such meticulous passion that to this day we are bewondered by their quality and charm. Runes are always a mystery. These sigils, full of secrets are always something that catches the eye and raises questions about the forgotten lore of ancients. The runes used to functioned as letters, but they were much more than just letters. Each rune was a sigil of some supernatural power and to write a rune was to invoke and direct the force for which it stood. Runes were traditionally carved onto stone, wood, bone, metal, or some similarly hard surface rather than drawn with ink and pen on parchment. This explains why we choose them for carvings on the dice. We wont to make durable dice imbued with the power of magic because there is “real magic” in roleplaying games. Now you can “write” tales about your adventures with Runic Dice. A little bit of mysticism These dice are marked with the Runic alphabet that makes them more than normal sets. People have been studying Runic writing for ages. Our designers have consulted the use of Runic alphabet not only with Nordic runemasters but with the last Dwarven race representatives too. We have made all that we could in order to make near all your dice rolls successful! The Runic Black & glow-in-the-dark Dice Set is imbued with the power of rune LAGUZ. This rune is associated with the universal ocean and its inner power that is waiting in depths and its life-giving glow, combining past, present, and future. Water is a symbol of life and unstoppable power that bypasses all obstacles. This rune looks like a magic arrow that pierces everything like water. These dice are for all mages and heroes concentrated on their inner power. They should be as a light in the darkness when their wisdom saves the day.

Classic is never outdated, never embarrassing and is a proof of a sense of style. It fits everything and is useful in every situation. It fits everyone, not only the rich and the snobs. The classic can be simple or sophisticated but it is never vulgarly ornate. The golden rule of moderation is what distinguishes it from all other things. So, how does the Q Workshop understand the classic Runic RPG dice? It is a set of polyhedral dice made from best materials according to a classically elegant design and crafted with simple but beautiful Runic font, readable as never before. These are no trinkets. It is a very useful set for all games. Available in many colors, these dice should help your heroes explore Dungeons, fight with Dragons, and let them find the right adventurous path in all worlds. These sets will be your friends. Take them with you wherever you play your favorite games. We are proud of our classic Runic dice sets because the simplicity of these game-tools has been combined with aesthetics. No one has the right to say that classic means boring and ordinary. We create beautiful dice, classic is not a deviation from this principle. The meaning of colors> colors play a very important role in our lives, whether we realize it or not. They have the ability to affect our emotions and moods in a way that few other things can. When you create your character, you should ask yourself what color suits your hero? What will be the best way to show his or her personality and tell something about it to other players? Maybe it is also worth choosing a special color for them. This non-verbal signal Can be a great help to create a more immersive atmosphere during the game. Should a warrior mage roll red and peaceful mystic green or maybe purple because he is noble? Show your colors with our classic Runic dice sets. For example: classic Runic black & red dice set – blood and darkness with runes, should I write more? It is still a very readable set in colors of darkest sorcery with all its shades. These are no dice for the peaceful mage but for the seasoned bitter warm age, who knows everything about the fight and is waiting for the next opportunity to send fireballs in face of his of her enemies. | 1.6 ounces (View shipping rates and policies)",,0.0453592,154.32370941286442,https://www.amazon.com/WORKSHOP-Classic-Runic-Black-Dice/dp/B07ZGGT9Q2

Quoridor is a multiple award-winning abstract strategy game. Try to get your pawn to the other side of the board. On your turn, you either move your pawn or place a wall. Can you successfully navigate the maze your opponent creates for you? Quoridor has become a standard among strategy games. Amazon.com A winner of many international commendations and awards, Quoridor Classic is a near-perfect game. Its objective is clear, not convoluted; the physical game is stylish, sturdy, and well made; and it has broad player appeal--it's great for families with players of varying ages. Quoridor Classic is a fast-moving strategy game that is similar to chess insofar as players move pawn-shaped pieces across the board. The difference is that there are wooden fences one erects to block the progress of and force a different route upon an opponent. The physical blocks are quite effective for discouraging daring moves, and encouraging more competitive players. Players utilize analytical and logistical thinking, as well as math-minded strategy. The game includes four pawn-shaped, smooth wooden pieces that are stylishly stained. The fences are natural wood. The playing board is made of heavy, carved wood that is richly stained and finished. Quoridor Classic accommodates two to four players. --Diane Beall From the Manufacturer The objective of the game is to advance your pawn to the opposite edge of the board. On your turn you may either move your pawn, or place a wall. You may hinder your opponent with wall placement, but not completely block him off. Meanwhile he tries to do the same to you. First pawn to reach the opposite side wins. It Includes 20 wood fence playing pieces, 4 pawns, wood game board and instructions. | 2.2 pounds (View shipping rates and policies)",,0.9979032140000001,34.95328956822059,https://www.amazon.com/GIGAMIC-GCQO-Quoridor/dp/B00001NTXN

EDUCATIONAL FEATURES: THINKING SKILLS - Figuring out how things work is one of the best parts of play. Simple challenges to more challenging ones can help in this area. Thinking Skills are mental processes we use to do things like: solve problems, make decisions, ask questions, construct plans, evaluate ideas, organise information and create objects. SHAPE RECOGNITION - Learning about the different shapes that exist not only broadens their knowledge of shapes but helps develop their fine motor skills as well as spacial recognition. PROBLEM SOLVING - Figuring out how things work are one of the best parts of play. Simple challenges to more challenging ones can help in this area. COMMUNICATION SKILLS - By role-playing and interacting with others through play, children can begin to develop their communication skills and start to understand social interaction in a better way. SOCIAL SKILLS -Feeling confident about yourself and being able to share your thoughts are essential to children’s development. Play can naturally do that. CREATIVITY - Using their imagination and creativity can assist children to see the world in a new way. This helps them to become great thinkers. HAND TO EYE COORDINATION - Teaches grasping and holding skills which leads to success in school and beyond. SPORTS - Hand eye co-ordination can help your child to catch a ball and hit a ball with a bat. HANDWRITING - Visual-motor integration, which is a vital skill for handwriting, grows out of a good hand-eye co-ordination base. The eyes need to guide the hand in forming the letters and making sure they stay within the lines. READING - Eye tracking skills, which are vital for reading, can be developed through games and activities used for hand eye coordination. PLAY AND LIFE SKILLS - Young children use this skill in learning to stack towers, build with bricks etc, and we even use hand eye coordination to tie shoelaces and frost cakes.

I'm the eldest daughter in the family, and I grew up with the wooden games my father crafted. I'd watch him select wood, dry it naturally and assemble to complete a game. They are challenging and fun — something you’ll never find in computer games. My father founded our family's game workshop. He created brain teasers, interlocking puzzles and wooden board games. My favorites are the wooden games because I grew up with them. They teach me to think, plan and concentrate, and I apply these skills in my everyday life. Along with the wooden games, we now craft wooden tableware. People appreciate the beauty and the uniqueness of the natural wood pattern.' | 1.05 pounds (View shipping rates and policies)",,0.4762719885,35.58890803841595,https://www.amazon.com/NOVICA-Light-Brown-Hand-Made/dp/B01LZZBKNY

This time with animals! They each have a lesson to teach, whether it’s how to spit really far, or what kind of grass tastes the best. It’s a lot to keep track of, but you’re like an elephant: you remember everything. And you’re afraid of mice. You’ve taken up riding. Horses are intimidating; they say you can lead a horse to water, but you haven’t managed it. So you’re working your way up, starting with dogs. So far so good; the dog hasn’t bucked you off yet. Your menagerie got off to a poor start, with just a goat, two rats, and the advisor who suggested starting a menagerie. You couldn’t get that fox you wanted, but it was probably bad anyway. Now you’ve got some camels, which are just as useless for sewing as you’d been warned, and a turtle that can hold its breath for longer than anyone can stay interested. Soon the animal kingdom will be yours. This is the 13th expansion to Dominion®. It has 400 cards, with 30 new Kingdom cards. There are Horses that save a draw for later, Exile mats that cards can be sent to and rescued from, and Ways that give Actions another option. Events return. Dominion: Menagerie is an expansion, and cannot be played by itself; to play with it, you need the Basic cards and rulebook (Dominion provides both). Dominion: Menagerie can also be combined with any other Dominion expansions you have.
